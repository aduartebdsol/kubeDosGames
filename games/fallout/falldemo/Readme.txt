Versions
--------

  At this time, there is no DOS version of the demo.

  A Macintosh version of the demo is also available separately
from the Fallout shelter at www.interplay.com/fallout.

Instructions
------------

  To install the Fallout interactive demo, use WinZip or PKunzip 2.04g to
decompress the files to a directory on your hard drive (FALLDEMO works well).
If you use PKunzip 2.04g, you must use the "-d" option to create the proper
subdirectories.  If you use WinZip, the Use Directory Names box must be
clicked on.  All of the Fallout demo files must be in the same directory.

  Play instructions are in the manual.  Double-click on the MANUAL.DOC file
to open it.  You must have a version of Wordpad or Microsoft Word installed
to view the manual.  For best results, you will need the fonts Impact and
Times New Roman.

Disclaimer
----------

  This is an interactive demo of the beta version of Fallout.  There are
missing and non-implemented features.  Interplay Productions reserves the
right to make changed between this demo and the final product.  For more
details, refer to the MANUAL.DOC.

Known Problems
--------------

 * This version of the Win95 demo does not work with original SoundBlaster
1.5, 2.0 and SoundBlaster Pro cards.  The demo will run, but not play sound.
This is a known bug, related to problems with DirectX.  At this time, there
is no workaround or fix.
 * The demo volume preference does not function.  This will be fixed.
 * On some systems, the demo will not function with Win95 Virtual Memory
turned off.  We are investigating.
 * The Review and Tell Me About buttons on the dialogue screen do not
function in this demo.  There is no feedback that they are not functioning.
