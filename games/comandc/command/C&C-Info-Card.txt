* Note on the freeware release *

Electronic Arts, the current owner of the Command & Conquer franchise, made
the full version of Tiberian Dawn available as a free download to celebrate
the twelfth anniversary of the series in September 2007.

The official download page used to be located at:
http://www.commandandconquer.com/classic

It is now accessible only via the Wayback Machine, as Electronic Arts removed
the downloads to save hosting space once it made sure that enough fan sites
mirrored the files, as explained here:
https://forums.cncnet.org/topic/10479-are-the-first-three-cc-still-considered-freeware/

The game can be downloaded from FilePlanet (as of 24 Jun 2020):
